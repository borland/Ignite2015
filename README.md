 - [SerialQueue project](https://github.com/borland/SerialQueue)
 - [GoRoutines-FileScanner](https://github.com/borland/Ignite2015/tree/master/goroutines-filescanner) (UWP demo filescanner app using goroutines and channels)
 
 Other things that I didn't show in the talk but that might be interesting
 
 - [SafeHandleCs](https://github.com/borland/Ignite2015/tree/master/SafeHandleCs) and [SafeHandleCpp](https://github.com/borland/Ignite2015/tree/master/SafeHandleCpp) show how to use SafeHandles to nicely do P/Invoke without finalizers or messy IntPtrs
 - [AndAnd/Tap](https://github.com/borland/Ignite2015/blob/master/andand/Program.cs) Some sample code showing C# conversions of AndAnd and Tap from ruby. I cut these from the presentation for time, but Tap in particular can be quite handy
